## Abstract
Water filtration is performed at the end of the water treatment process to remove the last 5% of turbidity to EPA standards of 0.3 NTU or less. The OSU research team is pairing with AguaClara Reach to adopt the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) filter to continue research on water flow rate, coagulant dose, sand size, and natural organic material. The Spring 2021 OSU research team spent the spring semester doing a literature review, transferring information from AguaClara Reach, and ordering parts to create a manual lab station. In the future, the team plans to use the manual lab station to begin experimental testing before transitioning to an automated system using ProCoDa near the end of Summer 2021. This research will be used to create a physics-based model that optimizes the water filtration process to be used internationally by AguaClara water treatment plants.  
## Introduction
The purpose of the project is to optimize the water filtration process and create a physics-based model using the variables: water flow rate, coagulant dose, sand size, and natural organic material (NOM) presence. The SP21 semester was the second semester working on this project at Ohio State. During the AU20 semester, one student spent time becoming familiar with the system and ordering parts for it. Three additional students joined the research team for the SP21 semester and there were also biweekly meetings with AguaClara Reach. The project was greatly accelerated during this semester and this report includes details for the process that we completed, the design of our filtration system, plans for future work, and recommendations for future teams creating AguaClara research at their universities. 
## Literature Review
Water filtration is the second to last step in the water treatment process [1]. It removes the last 5% of turbidity to achieve turbidity of 0.3 NTU or less [2]. Containments in the water are difficult to remove at their natural small size. A coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PACl), is added to the influent water to make the particles stick together in larger flocs. As the particles become larger, they are easier to remove. Most particles are removed during the sedimentation process when the flocs settle out of the water [1]. Then, the water is filtered, and chlorine is added to eliminate any pathogens [3]. 

The filtration process involves water flowing through pores in the sand within the filter. As the water flows through, the remaining flocs stick to the sand and become stuck in the pores. The filter operates more efficiently when some flocs have already been deposited [1]. The time it takes for flocs to be deposited is the ripening time [3]. As pores at the start of the filter become clogged, water flows through the constrictions more rapidly. The additional force of the water flow prevents additional flocs from sticking to the sand and the water will flow to an area of the filter with open pores. The area in the filter that is removing particles is the active zone. The active zone moves down the filter as pores at the top of the filter become filled. Once most of the pores become filled, the effluent turbidity rapidly increases. This is the breakthrough time of the filter. Once the filter is filled, it must be cleaned through a process called backwash. Water is pumped through the filter in the reverse direction at a higher flow rate to fluidize the sand bed. The fluidization removes particles that were removed during the filtration process [1]. 
## Timeline
## Process
Before research could begin, the OSU research team had to engage in a transfer of knowledge with the AguaClara Reach team. This took place in meetings once a week throughout most of the semester and allowed for the research team to better understand the filtration process and lab procedures. Along with the weekly meetings, the OSU research team reviewed previous research by students in Cornell University’s AguaClara research program, as well as technical literature like the AguaClara Textbook. This continued throughout much of the semester for the OSU research team to continue to better understand the water filtration system. 

Once a general idea of the experimental apparatus was understood, the OSU research team began designing the layout of their Apparatus. The design continued to be edited for a few weeks as the OSU team gathered more information on the system and the AguaClara Reach team reviewed the plans. 

The OSU team already had a list of needed materials at the start of the semester and worked to order the initial items quickly. As the experimental apparatus was developed and the overall understanding of the system improved, more materials were added to the list to be ordered. Ordering the materials took significantly longer than expected due to unexpected administrative roadblocks. The students on the research team would shop for the materials and send a list of them to the OSU lecturer leading the project to order them. The OSU team also applied for a Sustainability Grant through Ohio State University to help acquire more materials. 

This semester was the OSU research teams first in the new lab space. The team spent time getting trained on lab safety and spent time organizing the space.  
## Experimental Apparatus
The experimental apparatus was initially created by AguaClara and students at Cornell University to model AguaClara’s water treatment system. The AguaClara treatment system is gravity-powered and utilizes the unit treatment process of coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, rapid sand filtration, and chlorination. The experimental setup is aimed to research the rapid sand filtration process. Being able to model the stacked rapid sand (StaRS) filter allows for coagulant doses, turbidity removal, backwash, and breakthrough time to all be researched [1]. 

An overview of the experimental apparatus can be seen below in Figure 2, which is a flow chart provided by AguaClara [4]. The system first pumps water at a designated flow rate through the system where clay and coagulant (PACl) are added to the flow to add turbidity and to begin the treatment process. A flow accumulator is used before the addition of the clay solution to even out the flow produced by the influent water pump. This accumulator is a plastic jar with two holes drilled into it that allow for the entrance and exit of the water while allowing the flow to smooth out. The pumps used are peristaltic pumps that produce flow by opening and constricting the tubing to produce “plugs” of water that must be regulated by the accumulator. After the clay solution is added to the influent water, the water then flows into a turbidimeter that measures the turbidity of the water before any treatment occurring and provides a baseline for the effectiveness of the system. The water then has a pre-determined amount of the coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PACl), added to it and then travels into the flocculator. The flocculator uses tubing wrapped around a cylindrical object to allow the water, clay, and coagulant to mix and to mimic the flocculation portion of the AguaCara treatment process. Once the water is fully mixed by the flocculator, the next portion of the experimental apparatus is the StaRS filter itself. On the way to the filter, the water passes through both a pressure sensor and a check value. The purpose of the pressure sensor is to measure the headloss occurring in the filter based on the pressure differential before and after the filter. The goal of the check value is to ensure that the water cannot flow backward through the system and that the water always flows to the filter rather than away from it. The sand filter itself is a column of sand where the water enters at the top, flows downward through the filter, and exits the filter as treated water at the bottom. This flow through the sand filter can be more easily seen in Figure 3 below, which shows a diagram of the lab bench set up that will be built by the Ohio State research team. Once the treated water leaves the filter apparatus, the treatment process is completed and the water flows through the effluent turbidimeter where the turbidity is measured to compare to the initial measurement prior to filtration.  

An important operation feature of a rapid sand filter setup is the need for backwashing. Backwashing is the process of cleaning a sand filter and removing all the suspended solids, flocs, and contaminants that are adhered to the sand grains. As the treatment system operates, eventually the filter will become too overloaded with solids and the efficiency of the system will rapidly decrease. Backwashing occurs when water is allowed to flow into the filter from the bottom and at a much higher velocity than the system normally utilizes. This high velocity is required to fluidize the sand particles and to remove the contaminates. The dirty backwash water flows completely through the column and out of the system to a waste area, leaving behind a cleaned sand filter. The experimental apparatus uses a 600 RPM pump for the influent water compared to the 100 rpm pumps used for the clay and PACl as the extra power/speed is needed to have the backwash flow at a high enough velocity for the cleaning to occur.
## Fabrication Details
The fabrication of the experimental apparatus mainly consists of the tubing and fittings required for the flow of water and of the sand filter itself. The tubing for the entire main water flow will be a ¼" plastic tubing, while the clay and PACl solution will use microtubing. These tubing sizes are selected to keep the flow velocity and the headloss of the system within reasonable bounds. All the fittings in the system will be push-to-connect fittings that are assembled by pushing a tube into them, turning the tube, and then pushing the tube further into the fittings. The system will utilize 3-way fittings to connect the piping above and below the filter, as well as to connect the main flow line with the backwash line, as shown in Figure 3 above. Additionally, the last valve used in the system will be the check valve in-between the flocculator and the sand filter that prevents the water from flowing backward through the system. Once the tubing and fittings are planned out and ready to be assembled, the pumps must be connected to the system. 

As mentioned previously, the system utilizes peristaltic pumps which are easy to assemble. For the 600 RPM water inlet pump, one side of the piping will be placed into the water source, then threaded through the front of the pump and connected to the first 3-way connection. Similarly for the other two 100 RPM pumps, one end of the microtubing will be placed in the source bottle, either the clay or coagulant storage, threaded through the front of the pump, and then connected to the main flow line of the system. For the flow accumulator portion of the system, two holes will need to be drilled into a 1 L plastic bottle. The hole for the water inlet will be drilled towards the top of the bottle, while the outlet whole will be more towards the bottom of the bottle. The bottle will then have some water added to it and the cap will be screwed on to keep the air inside of the bottle, which is crucial to the creation of steady flow. After leaving the accumulator, the tubing will need to be connected to the influent turbidimeter which is done by pushing the tube into the push-to-connect fitting on the influent side of the machine; this will be repeated with the outlet pipe on the other side of the machine. The flocculator portion of the experimental apparatus is created by wrapping a pre-determined amount of tubing around a cylindrical object. This amount of tubing is based on the diameter of the object it is being wrapped around. This can be found using an equation created by AguaClara and will be provided to the OSU research team in the future. The last part of the apparatus that needs to be created is the rapid sand filter itself.  

For the OSU research apparatus, a simplified version of the sand filter will be created. The sand filter column itself will be a 1-inch diameter plastic tube. Since this tube is larger than the piping being used, a series of fittings will be attached to the top and bottom of the filter to reduce the size to match the ¼" inch piping. These fittings will have a small piece of tubing coming out of them that will then be attached to the previously mentioned 3-way fittings at the top and bottom of the filter. The filter will then have sand added to it by unscrewing the top fitting, however, the sand should only be added up to the designed fill height. This sand height should be determined previously as the filter column must be two times the height of the sand to account for the bed expansion that occurs during the backwash process. The treated water leaving the filter then must be connected to the effluent turbidimeter as described previously and the waste line for backwash water should be connected to a waste collection area. For the backwash process the only features that need to be added to the system is a separate series of piping that runs from the initial 3-way fitting by the influent water pump to the 3-way fitting at the bottom of the sand filter as shown in Figure Y. In addition, manual values should be placed at the beginning of the backwash line, where the backwash line meets the filter, and where the backwash waste line leaves the filter to allow for those lines to be closed off.
## Materials
## Future Work
The team’s overarching objective is to improve the efficiency of water filtration by creating an optimized physics-based model of the filtration process. The SP21 OSU research team has spent their time predominately focused on literature review and gathering materials to assemble the manual lab station. The team is eager to begin experimental research of flowrate, sand size, and coagulate dosing.   

The first goal of the team is to assemble the manual lab station using the design and ordered parts obtained during the SP21 semester. The team hopes to transition to an automated lab station using ProCoDa near the end of Summer 2021. This requires the team to learn the Python coding language and its interaction with ProCoDa software to run the lab system.  

The team will conduct experiments varying three variables individually. For each process, a constant amount of clay will be added to tap water to reflect standard water conditions. A turbidimeter will be used to record influent and effluent water turbidity, and PACl coagulant will be added to the water before entering the flocculator and filter. Flowrate will be monitored using peristaltic pumps in the system. Sand size will be monitored by sifting sand to variable sizes using sieves of different mesh sizes. Lastly, the coagulant dosage will be monitored by adding various amounts of PACl to the system. The team advises using a small range of coagulant to eliminate the possibility of the filter becoming clogged with large flocs when an excess of coagulant is added. The recommended range of each variable is listed below.  

- Flowrate: 100 mL/min to 400 mL/min 
- Sand size: 0.15 mm to 2 mm 
- PACl coagulant dosage: 0.2 mg PACl/L to 0.65 mg PACl/L 

Experimentation of the effect of natural organic matter (NOM) will be completed last to determine its effect on other variables. This will be completed by adding humic acid to a clay solution to represent conditions of intake water. The experimental range of humic acid per liter of stock solution is shown below.  

- NOM: 5 g humic acid/L stock solution to 20 g humic acid/L stock solution 
- The team intends to test the accuracy of the model by manipulating multiple variables of the system as the physics-based model is created.  

During SU21, plans will also be made for experimental design. Towards the end of the summer, additional students will be added to the research team to replace graduating students.
## Conclusions and Recommendations
The research team was unable to build the system during this semester because ordered materials have been delayed for over eight weeks. Students on the research team became knowledgeable about the filtration process and AguaClara. An emphasis of this semester was designing the system. Previous systems and lessons learned were evaluated to construct a system for the goals of the project. The system is well-understood and modeled in different formats. Significant progress was also made on establishing the lab space at Ohio State. A safety training was created and completed for the lab. Many tools and supplies were obtained and set up for the lab. The lab was operational and was utilized by other project teams during the semester. 

The research team has been steadily progressing through the process and has many lessons learned. Meetings with mentors from AguaClara Reach should start at the beginning of the semester. Biweekly meetings were determined to be an optimal meeting frequency. These meetings should be focused on getting questions answered and learning from presentations given by AguaClara Reach. The presentations were one of the most meaningful ways to disseminate information. Meeting minutes should be used more frequently to organize the work on the project. Ordering materials is an incredibly long process. This should be addressed first and have orders made as early in the process as possible. If there was a way to order materials directly from AguaClara Reach that would be helpful. They could provide a “Get Started Kit” for future universities researching with AguaClara. An important skill that the research team developed was identifying and discussing potential tasks that could slow down the overall project. Identification of the slowest and most important tasks helped keep the project moving.
